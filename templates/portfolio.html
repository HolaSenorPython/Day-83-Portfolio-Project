                    old, and my favorite part about code is when everything finally comes together. Clich√© I know. üò≠ I started
                learning how to code from Angela Yu's course, which wasn't even bought by me as a matter of fact, and I dreaded
                it. But now I love it! Pictured in the background is Arsenal legend Thierry Henry.</p>

                it inspired me to add many more features to it, and make the website truly my own.</p>

                <p class="lead pt-4">One of my favorite projects. It spanned multiple days in the course, and I learned
                    more and more as I worked on it: Authentication with Flask, FlaskWTForms, Databases,
                    etc. Although some days it was a little tough, overall I loved making it, and I'm glad I can have
                something I can call mine out there on the web. Deploying it was a teensy bit confusing at first üòÖ
                because I didn't understand GitHub and Git and Render, but I got the hang of it eventually (not
                without help from Angela of course! ü§•) All in all: I'm proud of it, and it was an important step
                in my growth as a programmer.</p>

                <p class="lead pt-4">Throughout a time period of around 5-6 days, the course covered Selenium and automation.
                Honestly? It was really fun and cool to think about! I could make a bot do things I'm too lazy to do,
                or have a bot go on Instagram! Obviously, with great power comes great, GREAT responsibility, and I
                would never do anything malicious. But it was really fun making these accounts for my bot to tweet or
                follow someone on Insta all without me laying a finger! The sad part? I couldn't make this code live!
                (at least for free.) I was excited to have my bot tweet once a day complaining about our internet, but
                unfortunately that didn't happen. üòî But these were some of my favorite days in the course as well.
                To the left is one of the accounts that was automated. üò≥</p>

                <p class="lead pt-4">I think all people with a slight interest in code have wanted to make a game before.
                These days were fun, and it felt superb to have games on my PC that I could call my own. The games ranged
                    from old arcade classics like Snake and Pong, to a U.S. States quiz game! (That was my
                favorite game made.) I also reckon they were pretty fun games too üòè. However, I must clarify that
                while most of the course involves the student coding and doing stuff on their own, you still have videos
                and Angela to guide you. This point is important to mention when I speak of the FINAL project I want to
                    showcase next. (I'm also very proud of it!) Pictured to the right is the Snake Game.</p>

                <p class="lead pt-4">Yes. The big reveal. I am very proud with this website and the way it turned out!
                    You see, starting from Day 81 onward, there are no videos or anything anymore, one merely makes what
                    it says for that day. Bootstrap snippets are lifesavers. ü§£ But it feels so good to have completed
                    this project. Honestly, this is probably not what a portfolio website looks like traditionally, and
                    I'm fine with that. This website is authentic. It's me! And I love it! I hope you, the user, are
                    enjoying it as well. Cheers to many more projects I will contribute to the web one day! üç∑
